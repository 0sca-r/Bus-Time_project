      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>Its pretty simple! wait for anyone to get off first, then 
      walk up, say hello to the driver, and give them the money! (if you forgot how much exactly you need just bring 2.50, thats the most you'll ever have to pay) 
      then you'll get a ticket (that you can use to ride any bus for 1 hour). when you want to get off just press the red button, and the driver will stop at the nearest stop, so plan ahead!
          
      Also if you want to get the discounts, you need to provide evidence (student ID, ect)
